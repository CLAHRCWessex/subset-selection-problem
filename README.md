# subset-selection-problem

**Created by**:
* Christine S.M Currie
* Thomas Monks

**Description:**

Testing ranking and selection code to select the best subset of systems 

The code tests the algorithms:

* Optimal Computer Budget Allocation - m (`OCBA-m`)
* `BootComp`

The algorithms are tested against a number of well known problem instances from the simulation literature. 

**Sources:**
* OCBA-m: https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ijoc.1080.0268
* BootComp: https://github.com/CLAHRCWessex/BootComp

**Instructions:**

All experiments are found within two notebooks:

* OCBA_M_Experiments.ipynb
* BootComp_Experiments.ipynb

**Please note** that the experiments are relatively computationally expensive.  Expect a run time of several hours to reproduce results

**Dependencies**

The algorithms are implemented in `Python 3.x`.  It is recommended that users install an up-to-date Anaconda distribution https://www.anaconda.com/  

It is recommended that users download, create and activate the environment file for BootComp to install the correct version of dependencies.  Please see https://github.com/CLAHRCWessex/BootComp for instructions.
